# Microsoft Graph - Getting Started with a .NET Core Console

This demo is based on the [Build .NET Core apps with Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/tutorials/dotnet-core) getting started guide.

We will be using a "customized" version of this guide as we want to build on the latest .NET Core templates and generate a simpler application. Please follow the following steps to build your Microsoft Graph app :

1. [Introduction](./docs/01-intro.md)
2. [Create a .NET Core console app](./docs/02-create-app.md)
3. [Register the app in the portal](./docs/03-register-app.md)
4. [Add Azure AD authentication](./docs/04-add-aad-auth.md)
5. [Get signed in user emails](./docs/05-add-ms-graph.md)
6. [Send a new email](./docs/06-send-email.md)
7. [Congratulations!](./docs/06-send-email.md)
